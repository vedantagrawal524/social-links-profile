# 👤 Social Links Profile

This is a solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It's a beginner-level project aimed at practicing layout, spacing, hover states, and responsive design using pure HTML and CSS.

## Overview

A clean, modern social profile card built using only HTML and CSS. This component displays a profile image, name, location, short bio, and several social links with hover effects. The challenge helped me practice layout structure, spacing, responsiveness, and interactive elements.
